# Optimization of Secondary Stats Priority for Blood Death Knight in World of Warcraft

## Description
This project serves as the final assignment for CS524: Introduction to Optimization. 
It addresses a real-world problem encountered while playing World of Warcraft, specifically focusing on 
optimizing the allocation of secondary stats for a Blood Death Knight to maximize survivability. 
The analysis is conducted based on the game's expansion 10.1, known as "The Dragonflight."

The project formulates the problem as an optimization challenge, constructing a mathematical model 
that incorporates key talent parameters and accounts for the diminishing returns mechanism introduced in the 9.0 expansion.
The optimized allocation strategy for secondary stats is derived for gear levels ranging from 350 to 500. 
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, revealing that the survivability of the Blood Death Knight 
exhibits a moderate level of sensitivity to certain secondary stats. 

For detailed information, including the mathematical model, code implementation, and results, please refer to the 'Project_Report.pdf' document.
